        <p> Hello my name is Taniya Trinidad (like the island), most of my friends call me Niy or Niya. I am from Sicklerville, NJ and I am 23 years old. I 'm a senior at the University of Miami with a major in Criminology and a minor in Motion Pictures, with a Web Mobile Design Cognate. I have a huge interest in the criminal justice system but I also have a second interest for film, art, and design, always have. If I could combine all in the same category, I would, maybe one day I will. I love being creative and day dreaming. I have a very versatile and adventurous personality, I have a lot of interests for alot of different things. I am workout freak, shopping alcoholic, and movie fanatic, I've probably seen every movie to exist.This website is too showcase some of my favorite sketches that I did during quarantine 2020. As a lot may know the country was impacted by a deadly virus Covid 19. This virus left us stuck in our homes for months practically, with a lot of time on our hands. So what better way to take advantage of that time, then draw up a couple of fun and cute sketches.</p>

        <p>These sketches I've done are just apart of my imagination, extremely random . Just something I tend to do from here and there. Just me in my own world. Sketching releases me and calms me down whenever I'm in a stress state of mind. If you wanna start sketching and have any questions for me, feel free to click on my contact link above, via email. You can also click the link below to bring you down to my gallery section of the page.
        Now Enjoy a peek into my gallery!!!</p>
